## [Unreleased]

## [47.6.0] - 2026-09-23

Upgrading: the model loses its git tools until skipper is installed and
registered. Install `skipper-mcp` (`just install-skipper` or the installer at
https://github.com/seuros/skipper), then run `chaos mcp add skipper -- skipper-mcp`.
See the Drivers section of `man/chaos-install.7.md`.

### Added
- `drivers/skipper` submodule: MCP driver for local git and GitHub, GitLab,
  Gitea, and Forgejo read access.

### Removed
- In-tree `git_*` tools and the `git` / `git-write` tool groups. Local git
  access for the model now comes from skipper.
- `git://branches` resource template.
